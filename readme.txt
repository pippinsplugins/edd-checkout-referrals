Allows a customer to select an affiliate at checkout to receive commission on their purchase

== Description ==

Use case:
Perfect use case is when your affiliates are setup as NPO (Nonprofit organizations). A customer can select the NPO from checkout, and that NPO will receive a commission on the sale. If a site visitor is already using an affiliate url (/ref=123), the select menu is not shown at checkout.

1. Shows a select menu at checkout (but only when a referral link is not used) that allows a customer to select an affiliate that their purchase will be credited to.
1. Adds a payment note to the EDD receipt showing the referral ID, amount recorded for affiliate, and affiliate's name
1. Allows a customer to search through the affiliate list at checkout
